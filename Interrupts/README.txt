Arduino and Raspberry Pi, Both are awesome in their specific ways but Attaching an external timer interrupt is so simple in arduino and yeah 
RPi also does the same kinda thing using daemon threads so i thought to give it a go and see how it compares to my made code!
also i wanted to make it look exactly like arduino syantax the : 
attachInterrupt() #Syantax
so . here goes nothing.
